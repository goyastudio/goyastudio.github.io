## Project Overview

This project developed a generative AI model for optimizing the design of Molded Case Circuit Breaker (MCCB) injection-molded components in collaboration with LS ELECTRIC. The 2-year initiative demonstrated that AI-driven design can successfully integrate with mass production processes, from initial concept through mold fabrication, prototype production, and physical testing.

## My Role

**Project Manager & Technical Lead**
- Defined core problem statements and project scope
- Led technical implementation and hands-on development
- Coordinated cross-functional collaboration between AI research team and manufacturing engineers
- Managed the entire product development cycle from AI model development to physical validation

### Performance Improvements
- **19% increase in fracture strength** while maintaining the same component weight
- **50x increase in design alternatives**: Generated and evaluated ~1,000 design options (vs. ~20 in traditional workflows)
- **Design review time reduced to ~30 seconds** through AI-powered performance prediction
- **75% reduction in design iteration cycles** expected for future projects

### Technical Innovation
- Developed hybrid AI system combining **generative AI** for design synthesis and **predictive AI** for performance analysis
- Delivered designs in **editable CAD format** fully compatible with injection molding manufacturing constraints
- Established end-to-end workflow from AI design generation to physical prototype validation

## Technical Approach

The project integrated two complementary AI technologies:

1. **Generative AI Model**: Creates diverse design alternatives optimized for mechanical performance while respecting manufacturing constraints
2. **Predictive AI Analysis**: Rapidly evaluates structural performance of generated designs, replacing time-intensive finite element analysis

This combination enabled rapid exploration of the design space while ensuring manufacturability and performance requirements.

## Impact

The successful completion of this project demonstrated the viability of AI-driven design for precision manufacturing components. The methodology and tools developed can be applied to other electromechanical components, potentially transforming traditional design workflows in the electrical equipment industry.
